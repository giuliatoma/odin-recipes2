        <img src="Hamburger.jpg">
        <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>½ tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>4 slices mature Cheddar</li>
        <li>4 white rolls</li>
        <li>1 beef tomato</li>
        <li>ketchup (optional)</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
