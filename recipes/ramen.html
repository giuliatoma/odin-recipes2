    <h1>Ramen</h1>
    <img src="Ramen.jpg">
    <p>On a cold winter's day, there's only one food that will both fill and warm you up: ramen. That beautiful rich broth will magically warm your bones, and those delicious noodles, meat and vegetables will sate even the biggest appetites.</p></p>Almost every region in Japan has its own variation on the dish and, here in Berlin, we also have a wide variety of ramen options to choose from.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>Sesame oil</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Ginger</li>
    <li>Chicken broth</li>
    <li>Soft-boiled egg</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, you’ll add the garlic and ginger, and simmer until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the veggies you want to cook—in this recipe, the carrots and mushrooms—and cook them until they soften up.</li>
        <li>Transfer the broth to the pot and add the rice vinegar, soy sauce, and Sriracha. Give the broth a good stir to combine the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Let the soup simmer for about five minutes, then give it a taste and add more soy sauce or Sriracha if needed. (This depends on how salty and spicy you want it.)</li>
        <li>While the soup simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the packages instructions.</li>
    </ol>
